# API Folder Structure

In this `api` folder, you will find the following components:

1. **Controller**: Golang handlers that handle incoming HTTP requests. It's recommended to use interfaces in this part for better code organization and testability.

2. **Routes**: Routing definitions for mapping incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate controllers.

3. **Middleware**: Middleware functions that can be used to intercept and process HTTP requests before they reach the controllers. Make sure to adhere to the HTTP router you're using for consistency.

4. **DTO (Data Transfer Objects)**: This folder contains structures for request and response objects. These structures define the format of data exchanged between the client and server.

5. **CMD (Command)**: This folder typically contains the `main.go` file, which serves as the entry point for your application.

It's essential to organize your code following this structure for better maintainability and scalability of your API project.
